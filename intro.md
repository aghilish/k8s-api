Today, we'll cover the following topics:
First, we'll explore extending the Kubernetes API, followed by API aggregation. Next, we'll introduce Kubebuilder and guide you through creating your own API. We'll discuss marker comments and automation, then dive into defining the spec and status in a Custom Resource Definition, or CRD. After that, we'll show how to make custom resources work with client-go and explore choosing the right resource scope. We'll also cover designing the CRD spec, understanding the status subresource, and installing the CRD. Finally, we'll touch on the Common Expression Language, additional printer columns, validation ratcheting, and wrap up with final remarks.
Letâ€™s get started!
